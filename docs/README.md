Crytographically secure of statistical Data Analysis (CODA)
==
CODA is built for doing secure outsourcing, specifically for the computation of statistics.
The statistics supported by CODA:

* Mean/Variance/Covariance
* Histogram
* Contingency table (cell-suppression supported)
* Percentile
* Principle component analysis
* Linear regression

This is project is based on this [paper](https://www.internetsociety.org/doc/using-fully-homomorphic-encryption-statistical-analysis-categorical-ordinal-and-numerical-data).

## Outline of CODA
![coda-outline](coda-outline.svg){width  = 35%}
In CODA, we have three stakeholders: analyst, data contributor, cloud server.

**Analyst** is an entity that

* generates homomorphic key-pair (e.g., public encryption key and private decryption key) and distributes the public key to the data contributor;
* aims to conduct statistical analysis based on the data collected from data contributors.

**Data contributor** is an entity that

* privately holds data. For instance, hospital that holds patients' medical records which are sensitve data and needed to be kept privately;
* encrypts the private data using the public key generated by the analyst;
* sends the ciphertexts to the cloud server.

**Cloud server** is an entity that

* provdies computational resources and storage volume for computations;
* receives requests from the analyst and do the responding computation on ciphertexts that collected from the data contributors.

### Notice

* In advance, the analyst and data contributors should have some aggrements about the data, e.g., the precision of fixed-point values, 
    the ways of pre-processing the plain data.
* Since the analyst holds the decryption key, the data contributors need to trust the analyst and the cloud are collusion-free. In other words,
    the cloud server will not give the ciphertexts that collected from the data contributors to the analyst.
