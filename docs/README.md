Crytographically secure of statistical Data Analysis (CODA)
==
CODA is built for doing secure outsourcing, specifically for the computation of statistics.
The statistics supported by CODA:

* Mean/Variance/Covariance
* Histogram
* Contingency table (cell-suppression supported)
* Percentile
* Principle component analysis
* Linear regression

## Outline of CODA
![coda-outline](coda-outline.svg)
In CODA, we have three stakeholders: analyst, data contributor, cloud server.

_Analyst_ is an entity that

* generates homomorphic key-pair (e.g., public encryption key and private decryption key) and distributes the public key to the data contributor;
* aims to conduct statistical analysis based on the data collected from data contributors.

_Data contributor_ is an entity that

* privately holds data. For instance, hospital that holds patients' medical records which are sensitve data and needed to be kept privately;
* encrypts the private data using the public key generated by the analyst;
* sends the ciphertexts to the cloud server.

_Cloud server_ is an entity that

* provdies computational resources and storage volume for computations;
* receives requests from the analyst and do the responding computation on ciphertexts that collected from the data contributors.
